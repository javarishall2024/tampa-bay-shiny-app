# tampa-bay-shiny-app

This is a collaborative Shiny app project developed as part of the Sports Analytics capstone course at Northwestern University. The project was built in partnership with classmate **Gregory Halperin**, under the instruction of **Brad Smith**.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Our interactive Shiny app analyzes batter-vs-pitcher matchups for the Tampa Bay Rays using Statcast data from the 2023 MLB season. The goal was to deliver a user-friendly tool for evaluating offensive tendencies and pitcher effectiveness based on real-world in-game performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Users can select batter and pitcher matchups.
- **Custom Data Filtering**: Choose based on handedness, pitch types, zones, etc.
- **Statistical Visualizations**: Heatmaps, pitch locations, and performance metrics.
- **Use Case**: Useful for scouting, opponent preparation, and strategy simulations.

## ðŸ§¾ Files Included

- `ShinyApp_FinalProject.R`: Main Shiny app code
- `TBBatterIDs.csv`: Batter information for app functionality
- `TBPitcherIDs.csv`: Pitcher information for app functionality
- `App Website Concept.docx`: Mockup of a potential web interface
- `Executive Summary.docx`: One-page high-level summary of findings
- `Shiny App Data Analysis Report.docx`: Full write-up of our methodology and findings
- `Shiny App User Guide.docx`: Walkthrough instructions for app users

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

- R programming (Shiny, dplyr, ggplot2)
- Data wrangling and cleaning
- Interactive dashboard development
- Baseball-specific statistical analysis
- Collaboration and technical documentation
